# Git Definitions
##aka...stuff I didn't know existed a week ago
** Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* Version control is a method to keep track to changes in code over time. It's useful in finding/fixing mistakes, along with allowing to turn back the clock in case of a loss.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* A branch is a separate line of code. They are useful to protect source code when adding new features or fixing bugs.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* A commit is the actual recording of changes. A good commit message is a clear description of what was changed.
* What is a merge conflict?
* Merge conflicts can arise when the same blocks of code are edited in different branches.
