    <h1>I Dig a pony</h1>
     <P>
      It's true. For the sake of rock and roll, I've found it best to dig ponies as opposed to zebras or horses. It's most important to 
      <strong>express </strong> to the pony your intentions to dig him/her. 
      <em>By "digging"</em> a pony, we of course mean to appreciate at a respectful level.</P>
    <p>Here's a few ways to dig ponies...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>brush their manes</li>
        <li>feed them carrots</li>
        <li>play them classical music</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Dug ponies will, in return...</p>
      <ol>
        <li>love you</li>
        <li>protect your farm</li>
        <li>plow your fields</li>
      </ol>
